# patient-management
This project keeps track of patient data including their first and last name, date of birth, diagnosis, insurance, visits, and the amount due to the healthcare system. It saves its information into an SQLite database to keep track of the data. It also utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

# Features
- Patient Data Management: Add, update, delete, and view patient data.
- Database Storage: Utilizes SQLite for persistent storage of patient information.
- GUI: User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
- Visit Tracking: Automatically updates the number of visits and the amount due based on insurance type.
- Unique ID Generation: Generates unique IDs for new patients.

# Project Structure
- patient.py: Contains the 'Patient' class, representing patient data.
- database.py: Contains the 'PatientManagement' class, which handles all database interactions such as adding, updating, fetching, and removing patient data.
- gui.py: Contains the 'PatientMangementGUI' class, which handlws the Tkinter GUI setup and user interactions.
- main.py: Entry point of the application, initializing the 'PatientManagementGUI' with the SQLite database file.

# Classes
# Patient

- display_data: Displays all patient data.
- display_single_data: Displays single patient data based on id.
- add_new_patient: Prompts the user to add a new patient.
- update_patient_data: Prompts the user to update a patient's data.
- record_patient_visit: Records a new visit for a patient.
- patient_pay: Updates the amount due based on a payment.
